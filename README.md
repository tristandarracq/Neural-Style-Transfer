# Neural Style Transfer

[Neural Style Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer) is the process of composing an image in the style of another image. Neural Style Transfer algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks in order to perform the image transformation. 

This technique was first introduced by Gatys et al. in [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
